## Inspiration 💡
Today the total amount of generating electricity about 4,108 billion kWh (or about 4.11 trillion kWh). About 61% of this electricity generation was from fossil fuels—coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases. In order to decrease the loss of energy 

## What it does 🔎
It predicts the average electricity usage/consumption based on model training data and analysis.
## How we built it 🔨
So for this project we used the famous rule "Divide and Conquer" where we divided the tasks into four parts, Front-end, backend, front-end for backend and modeling the data.
## Challenges we ran into ⚠️
It was difficult to identify and find the suitable kind of data for the machine-learning model.
Our first pass at integrating the model into the web application was quite bulky as well as took some time to infer from. Figuring out the bugs and fixing them was challenging as well.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🥇
We were able to learn some new things about html, flask and python and got our first project done in ML/AI. Understanding the workflow of a ML model in flask.

## What we learned 🧠
Flask, Python, Machine Learning, Designing and training model, Git/GitHub.

## What's next for electron 💭

For future we are planning to implement the graphical content that helps us understand the data more precisely and different curves and area of the graph can help us to predict many other things.
We are also planning to train our model further with more recent an continous data so that the future prediction that the model will provide will be more accurate.
